  origin: "publication/publication1"
  abstract: "Competition between synapses arises in correlation-based plasticity. We propose a game-theory-inspired model in which synapses switch between weak and strong states, driven by local competition and memory of past outcomes. The framework reproduces power-law forgetting and captures motor adaptation phenomena like savings and rebound via distinct timescales."  
  methodology: "We model each synapse as a binary unit updated by parallel/sequential rules. Synaptic transition probabilities depend on neighbors' states and a memory parameter. We derive mean-field equations, identify phases via simulations, and compare system-level learning and forgetting curves to existing motor adaptation data."

  abstract: |
    Emerging trends in neurosciences provide converging evidence that cortical networks in predominantly motor areas are activated in multiple contexts related to “action” that do not cause overt movement. For complex bodies—human or embodied robots—there must be a seamless alternation between shaping motor output during action execution and simulating potential actions for feasibility and understanding. Revisiting the Equilibrium Point Hypothesis and muscle‐synergy formation, this article proposes a “plastic, configurable” internal body‐schema as a unifying principle enabling both real and imagined actions through internal simulation. The theoretical rationale is grounded in intracranial recordings, fMRI studies of action execution/imagination, tool‐use experiments, and computational robot models to show how muscleless motor synergies arise from goal‐directed body‐schema animation.
  methodology: |
    This paper synthesizes interdisciplinary findings—neurophysiological recordings, fMRI, behavioural tool‐use studies, and robotics simulations—under a computational framework. The authors formalize an internal body‐schema model and Equilibrium Point Hypothesis to generate muscleless synergies. Computational experiments on simulated robotic limbs illustrate how body‐schema animation yields both overt and covert action trajectories without direct kinematic inversion. The approach integrates forward/inverse model comparisons, dimensionality reduction of synergy patterns, and tool‐incorporation case studies.

  origin: "publication/publication13"
  abstract: |
    Corvids, apes, and children solve the Crow and the Pitcher task, indicating causal understanding. To explore how agents abstract cause–effect relations from cumulative interactions, we re-enact the task on a robot equipped with a brain-guided neural model of semantic-episodic memory. Four task-agnostic learning rules compare expectations recalled from past episodes with current scenarios to extract hidden causal relations. Robot behaviors illustrate causal learning, and predictions for novel objects converge to Archimedes’ principle, independent of exploration order and object set.
  methodology: |
    The Crow and Pitcher task was implemented on an iCub robot. A neural architecture with semantic-episodic memory modules encoded object properties and past interactions. Four learning rules—discrepancy detection, semantic binding, episodic attenuation, and expectation update—were applied to compare recalled episode outputs to sensory feedback. Robot trials with objects of varying weight, shape, color, and volume tested causal inference. Behavioral outcomes were evaluated against physical principles.

  origin: "publication/publication14"
  abstract: |
    Cross-situational word learning (CSWL) requires tracking word–object co-occurrence across ambiguous naming scenarios to infer correct mappings. Prior work shows eye movements reflect learning success but may be influenced by object properties. This experiment will systematically vary object shape and colour distances on each trial—‘Near’ (similar) versus ‘Far’ (distinct)—while controlling stimulus pairs. Eye-tracking and forced-choice naming tests will assess how metric variation affects real-time attention and word‐learning accuracy.
  methodology: |
    Adult participants complete CSWL trials in a within-subjects design. On each trial, two novel objects appear with a novel label; object pairs are manipulated to be similar (‘Near’) or distinct (‘Far’) in shape or colour. Eye movements are recorded to track referent selection. After training, forced-choice tests measure word–object mapping accuracy. Statistical analyses compare learning across Near vs. Far conditions and correlate gaze durations with performance.

    This pre‐registered study investigates how the duration of stimulus exposure and participants’ looking behaviours jointly influence cross‐situational word learning. By manipulating exposure times and recording eye movements, we will examine contributions of associative learning versus hypothesis‐testing mechanisms across multiple ambiguous naming trials.
  methodology: |
    Adult learners complete CSWL tasks under varied stimulus exposure durations (short vs. long). Eye‐tracking captures real‐time fixations on each object during word presentation. Learning outcomes are assessed via forced‐choice tests. We fit computational models implementing associative accumulation and hypothesis‐testing algorithms to gaze and choice data to determine which processes dominate under different exposure conditions.

  origin: "publication/publication16"
  abstract: |
    Infants, children, and adults track word–object co‐occurrence across ambiguous naming situations to infer mappings. We introduce WOLVES, an implementation‐level neural process model grounded in memory and attention processes that simulates moment‐to‐moment gaze dynamics during CSWL. Fitting WOLVES to 12 published studies, we capture data supporting both associative and hypothesis‐testing accounts. WOLVES outperforms competitor models, generalizes to held‐out experiments, and elucidates developmental changes in memory constraints and real‐time gaze‐learning synchrony.
  methodology: |
    WOLVES integrates dynamic neural fields for visual exploration, a binding map for word–object associations, and memory buffers across multiple timescales. We parameterized the model to empirical eye‐tracking and forced‐choice accuracy data from infants to adults. Bayesian optimization estimated attention and memory decay parameters. Model fits were compared to associative learning and hypothesis‐testing algorithms using cross‐validation and percent‐error metrics.

  origin: "publication/publication17"
  abstract: |
    Visual exploration and auditory processing interact to support object discrimination, categorization, and early word learning. To clarify their complex, multi‐timescale interactions, we generalize a formal neural process model of word learning to simulate two infant studies of label‐driven novelty preference (9–22 months). Simulations explain label effects on looking and mutual‐exclusivity responses. We discuss criteria for formal theories and their integration with empirical paradigms.
  methodology: |
    The WOLVES dynamic neural process model was extended to simulate 9–22‐month‐olds’ novelty‐driven looking paradigms. Parameter settings for memory consolidation and attention dynamics were adjusted to match two empirical datasets. Model predictions of looking‐time curves and exclusivity choices were compared to published infant data. Goodness‐of‐fit was assessed via mean squared error and Akaike information criterion.

  abstract: |
    Knowledge graphs (KGs) encode structured relations across domains but are often incomplete. Traditional embedding methods struggle with unseen entities; text‐based models incur high computational costs and semantic inconsistencies. We introduce CAB‐KGC, a Context‐Aware BERT for KGC that leverages contextual information from neighboring entities and relations to predict missing tail entities. CAB‐KGC eliminates the need for entity descriptions and negative sampling, reducing compute while improving Hit@1 by 5.3% on FB15k-237 and 4.88% on WN18RR.
  methodology: |
    CAB‐KGC constructs head context (Hc) and relation context (Rc) by sampling k‐hop neighbors of the head entity and adjacent relation sequences. Hc and Rc are concatenated into BERT‐formatted input sequences and fine-tuned with cross‐entropy loss to predict tail entities. No negative sampling is used. Models are trained and evaluated on FB15k-237 and WN18RR, with Hit@k and MRR reported against TransE, ComplEx, and KG-BERT baselines.

  abstract: |
    Context manipulations reveal that similarity in object properties can counterintuitively facilitate word learning. Using the WOLVES dynamic field model, we simulated CSWL under two conditions: ‘NEAR’ (objects metrically similar) and ‘FAR’ (objects distinct). WOLVES predicted superior learning in NEAR trials. An adult behavioral experiment confirmed this novel prediction, demonstrating that contextual similarity enhances cross‐situational word mapping.
  methodology: |
    Adult participants (n=40) completed a CSWL task with 48 trials. On each trial, two objects differed either minimally (NEAR) or maximally (FAR) in colour or shape and were paired with a novel word. Eye‐tracking recorded fixations during training; forced‐choice tests measured mapping accuracy. The WOLVES model was parameterized to human gaze and accuracy data. Learning rates across conditions were compared using mixed‐effects logistic regression.

  abstract: |
    Accurate drug–target interaction prediction accelerates drug discovery. We frame the problem as link prediction on heterogeneous biomedical KGs integrating drugs, proteins, diseases, and pathways. Conventional KG methods rely on negative sampling and struggle with unseen pairs. We propose MuCoS, which prioritizes high-density neighbors to capture salient structural context and fuses these with BERT‐derived embeddings. MuCoS removes the need for negative sampling, reduces computational overhead, and yields up to 13% MRR improvement on KEGG50k and 6% on dedicated drug–target predictions.
  methodology: |
    MuCoS samples a fixed number of nearest neighbors in the KG to form multi-context subgraphs around each head–relation pair. Structural embeddings from TransE and contextual embeddings from BERT are concatenated and fed to a feed-forward network trained with cross-entropy loss. No negative samples are required. Performance is evaluated on KEGG50k using MRR and Hits@k against TransE, ComplEx-SE, and NeoDTI baselines.

  abstract: |
    Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and comparing link-prediction models in knowledge graphs. The Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric—derived from probabilistic divergence between classes within a spectral clustering framework—was proposed to quantify complexity, naturally scaling with class count and correlating with classification performance. We systematically evaluate CSG on multi-class tail-prediction tasks across standard benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR) by varying Monte Carlo sample size (M) and nearest-neighbor count (K). Our results reveal that CSG is highly sensitive to K and exhibits weak correlation with mean reciprocal rank (MRR), challenging its stability and predictive power in link-prediction settings and motivating the development of more robust, classifier-agnostic complexity measures.
  methodology: |
    We compute CSG on embedding spaces generated by standard KG embedding models, treating each candidate tail entity as a separate class. By varying M (Monte Carlo samples per class) and K (number of nearest neighbors), we derive CSG values for each head–relation pair. Correlation analyses between CSG scores and link-prediction metrics (MRR, Hits@k) are conducted across FB15k-237, WN18RR, and additional benchmarks. Sensitivity analyses assess the impact of parameter choices on CSG’s stability and scalability.

  abstract: |
    Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing entities or relations in incomplete graphs. Traditional embedding-based methods struggle with unseen entities and require negative sampling, while textual models incur high computational costs. We propose MuCo-KGC, a Multi-Context-Aware framework that leverages structural contexts from k-hop neighbor subgraphs around the head entity and query relation. MuCo-KGC eliminates the need for entity descriptions and negative sampling, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments on FB15k-237, WN18RR, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M demonstrate that MuCo-KGC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving MRR by 1.63% on WN18RR, 3.77% on CoDEx-S, and 20.15% on CoDEx-M.
  methodology: |
    MuCo-KGC samples fixed-size k-hop neighbor subgraphs to extract head context (neighbor entities) and relation context (adjacent relation sequences). These contexts are formatted into BERT-style input sequences and concatenated before being fine-tuned with cross-entropy loss to predict tail entities without negative sampling. The model is evaluated against TransE, ComplEx, and KG-BERT baselines using MRR and Hits@k metrics on FB15k-237, WN18RR, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M.
